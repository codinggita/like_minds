- Which problem Project is Solving?

  After having completed 2 years of offline college I have realised the importance of having the right people around you.
  The people you surround yourself with really matters. But finding like-minded people in the college, who are as ambitious as you are, as compeititive as you are, having similar interests and learning patterns was a challenge. Therefore, I want to build a platform wherein students of similar domain of interests can come together, learn together, build together and ultimately grow together. I want to make it particularly for my college. In order to keep it neat and precise.

- What are existing similar solutions?

  - Discord
  - Whatsapp communities

- How do you want to solve it?

  - Would like to explain this using an example.
    For eg., there is a student whose interested in competitive programming and would love to get to know people of the same interest in the college.
    Therefore, this platform will be the place wherein they can find people, ask questions, and get solutions to their queries. This will unable us to create network, increase our knowledge and making our learning journey easier.

- List of features you want to implement.
  - User Profile which contains their details like education, achievements and all.
  - Search bar wherein we can search people.
  - A chat feature.
  - A section displaying events and opportunities coming up in the college.
